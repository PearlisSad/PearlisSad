# About Me  

I’m a 2024 Computing Technologies graduate from Royal Holloway, University of London, with hands-on experience in software engineering, full-stack web development, and game development. During my degree, I built a range of technical projects using Python, Java, C#, Flask, React, and Unity.

I’m currently learning data analysis and machine learning through DataCamp. I'm using the platform to strengthen my skills in Python for data analysis, data wrangling, and statistics with the goal of applying these skills to real-world problems and eventually building machine learning models. 

 My long-term goal: **Data Scientist**  
 Current focus: data engineering, and analytics
